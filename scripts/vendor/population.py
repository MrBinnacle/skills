"""Population integrity for enumeration-driven controls (#453).

An enumeration-driven control discovers its own inputs -- it globs a directory,
walks a tree, or reads a register -- and then submits what it found to a
detector. Such a control can execute perfectly against the wrong universe: the
assertion is strong, the fixture is sound, and the answer is still
uninterpretable, because the set of cases that reached the detector was not the
set the control was supposed to analyse.

    negative control present   !=   negative control exercised

This module makes that set explicit, so a control can state which cases it
analysed and refuse to report an object-level result when it cannot establish
them as the declared cases.

The validity lattice this sits in
---------------------------------
::

    SOURCE / INPUT INTEGRITY
            v
    POPULATION INTEGRITY      <- this module
            v
    EXECUTION INTEGRITY
            v
    RESULT VALIDITY
            v
    CLAIM VALIDITY

Each layer gates the one above it, which yields the rule this module enforces:
**a downstream result cannot repair an upstream validity failure.** A perfect
assertion cannot repair an incomplete population. That is why :func:`interpret`
discards the detector's own outcome when the population is invalid rather than
combining the two.

The third verdict, and why it is not a FAIL
-------------------------------------------
A population failure is reported as ``UNINTERPRETABLE``, never as ``PASS`` and
never as an ordinary ``FAIL``::

    population_valid = false   ->   verdict = UNINTERPRETABLE     (correct)
    population_valid = false   ->   verdict = PASS                (the defect)
    population_valid = false   ->   verdict = FAIL                (a false finding)

``FAIL`` is wrong for the same reason ``PASS`` is: both are object-level claims
about the subject, and neither is available when the analysed universe is
unknown. This is the discipline already applied one layer up by
``ClauseStatus.UNMEASURED`` and ``KeepCutVerdict.CANT_TELL_YET``, which refuse
to interpret rather than manufacture a result; ``UNINTERPRETABLE`` is that rule
one layer down.

A detector saying "no defect found in the cases I received" may not become "no
defect exists" unless the system proves it received the complete declared
population.

Digest canonicalisation, specified rather than assumed
------------------------------------------------------
``population_digest`` is SHA-256 over::

    "population-v1\\n" + json.dumps(sorted(ids), ensure_ascii=False, separators=(",", ":"))

encoded UTF-8. Four properties, each chosen against a way the digest could
otherwise disagree between two honest runs of the same population:

- **Sorted.** Enumeration order -- ``glob`` order, filesystem order, dict
  insertion order -- must not change the digest. Only membership may.
- **JSON-encoded, not joined by a separator.** A separator-joined encoding is
  not injective: an identifier containing the separator makes two different
  populations hash the same. JSON escaping makes the encoding injective for
  every string.
- **Version-prefixed.** A future change to the canonicalisation is then a
  different digest by construction, rather than a silent collision with a
  digest computed under the old rule.
- **``ensure_ascii=False`` with an explicit UTF-8 encode.** The bytes hashed do
  not depend on the platform's default encoding.

Identifiers are opaque strings and the caller owns their platform stability.
For filesystem populations use :func:`posix_relative_ids`, which is the one
correct implementation of the path case: it makes paths relative to a root and
emits ``/`` separators, so a population enumerated on Windows and the same
population enumerated on Linux produce the same digest.

Duplicate identifiers are refused rather than de-duplicated. A duplicate means
the enumeration counted a case twice, and silently collapsing it would hide the
very defect a population record exists to surface.
